# SITFO_PSO
SITFO_PSO is a modified version of the SITFO algorithm. the modification is the optimizer algorithm used in the algorithms where SITFO uses SL-PSO and SITFO use PSO.  The algorithm is coded using Matlab toolbox PlatEMO 4.0: Tian, Ye, et al. "PlatEMO: A MATLAB platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization [educational forum]." IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine 12.4 (2017): 73-87. More details for NSGAIII-EHVI are shown in the paper "Pang, Yong, et al. "Surrogate information transfer and fusion in high-dimensional expensive optimization problems." Swarm and Evolutionary Computation 88 (2024): 101586." Pleae cite this paper if using this code.
